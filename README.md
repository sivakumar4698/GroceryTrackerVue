# grocerytracker Application in Vue

### The purpose of the application is to learn the concepts in VueJs.

### Application features

- Add groceries to your list
- Add the store where you want to get the grocery from
- set reminder for the groceries
- Delete the groceries from the list when completed

### Learning Outcome

Vue is becoming popular within the developer community, Im quite familiar with using React and combining technologies along with react to develop full stack applications. Now is time for me to dive into VueJs.

- Learning the VueJs component creations
- Using Json server as a API to perform CRUD operations 
- Passing down data between components
- Implementing the Vue Router
- emiting events within the pages and components
- Declaring data, methods and props within the components
- Managing the data within the components
- Creating methods to perform neccessary actions with the data

Overall it was a good learning experience. Will be diving more deep into VueJs, and probably develop a full stack application by combining vueJs with other technologies.
